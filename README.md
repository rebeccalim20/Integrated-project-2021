# Integrated-project-2021
Interactive Media Application (ECCOMERCE shopping APP )



# SHOOP

The project is about a shopping app where user can browse through the app and view more and understand about fashion, tech and beauty.

User will be able to browse through different feeds in regarding of fashion looks , skin care and technology, this will keep them updated on the latest trending products.
 
## Design Process

This application is mainly designed for anyone who enjoyed shopping online. Using our application will allow users to browse through different products from fashion, tech gadgets or skin care. With using our application, users  who make purchases will get the best discounted price while using vouchers. Also, we have a section where we share tips about fashion, tech and beauty.
 

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

- As a online shopping lover, I would like to view the tips about fashion and i will be able to do it by clicking the feeds tab and i will be able to view the tips on fashion, tech and even beauty skin care.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. 
These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory)
Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url. 

- This is the layout we did for Applied Design module and we are using it on our application.

## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Product page:
    1. Products able to link to another page for more details of the product with viewing of the descriptions
    2. Dropdown doesnt looks and works properly when scrolls back up with a smaller screensizing

2. Different browsers and screen sizes:
    1. The page layout manage to fit for all screen sizing and nicely 
    2. Overall neat appearance and looks
    3. Layout still doesnt seems to looks good on some screen sizes 
    
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
